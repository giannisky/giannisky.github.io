								<b>Seeding Supermassive Blackholes:</b> Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are ubiquitous in the Universe, as they are in the cen-
ters of nearly all massive galaxies. However, it is currently unknown how SMBHs become
supermassive in the first place. In this vein, my research thesis focuses on understanding the
seeding mechanism for supermassive black holes (SMBHs). Thus far, I have studied the ac-
tive galactic nuclei (AGN) occupation fraction in galaxies as a function of galaxy mass using
data from the Deep-Drilling Fields Extended Chandra Deep Field South (ECDFS) Survey,
XMM-Newton Survey (XMM-LSS), and Elais-S1 (ES1) Survey. This work aims to distin-
guish between different SMBH seeding mechanisms by quantifying their distribution in these
extensive extragalactic surveys.
More specifically, I am fitting the spectral energy distribution of different AGNs to quantify
the biases in identifying AGNs and better interpret the occupation fraction as a function
of galaxy mass. Future steps in my thesis will include estimating the black hole mass using
spectroscopy and scaling relations between the SMBH and the host galaxy bulge mass. These
quantities can then be used to further test models of SMBH seeding and determine the most
likely formation scenario.
